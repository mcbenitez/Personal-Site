    Hi, I'm Matthew.
  </h1>
  <p class = "textBody">
    I'm a full-time student at the University of California, Davis, majoring in Computer Science. I'm a theater kid at heart, an avid gamer, a modest spoken word poet, and passionate about computers and technology. In particular, I'm super interested in algorithms and Computer Vision. In fact, algorithm anaysis was one of the first that got me really interested in Computer Science. Thanks for visiting my site. Feel free to look around some more and check out what else I have here.
